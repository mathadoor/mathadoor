# Hello there, I'm Harpreet! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm ~~currently pursuing a~~ a recent graduate of a Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with a focus on Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing. My interest lies in applying these fields to solve complex real-world problems, and I am currently exploring opportunities to do so. 

## Projects :construction_worker:
* **Translating Handwritten Equations to Latex** This project involved the development of an image-to-text pipeline, which translates an input image to the corresponding equation. Learn more [here](https://github.com/mathadoor/ImageToLatex/blob/main/Readme.md)

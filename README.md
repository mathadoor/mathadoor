# Hello there, I'm Harpreet! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with a focus on Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing. My interest lies in applying these fields to solve complex real-world problems, and I am currently exploring opportunities to do so. 

## Projects :construction_worker:
* **Translating Handwritten Equations to Latex** This project involved the development of a image to text pipeline, which translates an input image to the corresponding equation. The underlying model used CNN to encode the feature maps of the image, which are later translated by a gated-recurrent unit based RNN model. The project culminated in demo end-to-end ML application deployed on Streamlit, which the user can use to translate a handwritten mathematical equation.
* **Transformer Exposition** This project involved creation of a stateful application in React.js that demonstrates the inner workings of the transformer architecture. The architecture demonstrated is that of neural machine translation and the interactive application is connected to a trained model hosted on AWS that allows the end user to see the actual output of the translation.
* **Transforming Visual QA to Lexical QA:** This project involved the development of a system that could summarize visual inputs and answer questions based on the content of those images. The ultimate aim was to enhance the performance of visual question answering systems.

More projects can be found in the repositories section. Feel free to explore and drop a star if you find something interesting!

## What I'm up to :dart:
* Working towards completing my Master's degree and consistently learning new technologies and methodologies in Computer Science and Machine Learning.
* Actively seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in real-world projects and contribute to the field of Machine Learning Engineering.

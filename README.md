# Hello there, I'm Harpreet! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with a focus on Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing. My interest lies in applying these fields to solve complex real-world problems, and I am currently exploring opportunities to do so. 

## My Journey so far :rocket:

* As a Senior Applications Engineer, I've gained hands-on experience in implementing data management solutions for clients in the manufacturing sector.
* Completed over 20 MOOC courses across platforms like Coursera, focusing on advancements in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Science.
* Worked on a transformative project for Visual QA to Lexical QA using a Transformer-based approach for better question-answering capabilities. More details can be found in the 'Projects' section.
  
## Projects :construction_worker:
* **Transforming Visual QA to Lexical QA:** This project involved the development of a system that could summarize visual inputs and answer questions based on the content of those images. The ultimate aim was to enhance the performance of visual question answering systems.

More projects can be found in the repositories section. Feel free to explore and drop a star if you find something interesting!

## What I'm up to :dart:
* Working towards completing my Master's degree and consistently learning new technologies and methodologies in Computer Science and Machine Learning.
* Actively seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in real-world projects and contribute to the field of Machine Learning Engineering.
